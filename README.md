# Bookmark_Counter

- I somehow managed to accumulate up to 10,495 bookmarks on my default internet browser. 
- It would appear I've bookmarked anything I considered remotely interesting and never found the time to go through them.
- Which is why I've created this console application to assist me with keeping track of the total number of bookmarks I have per day.
